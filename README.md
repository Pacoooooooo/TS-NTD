`Modeling transition matrix for dynamic collaborative filtering via temporal similarity based nonnegative tensor decomposition`

All the numerical computations are conducted on an Intel Core CPU 64GB RAM computer. MATLAB R2019a is adopted as the computing platform. 
MATLAB Tensor Toolbox^[1] is employed whenever tensor operations are called.
